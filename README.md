# Welcome to miniRT Project! ðŸ‘‹

miniRT is a small Ray Tracer project implemented as part of the curriculum at 42 School of Perpignan. 

## About miniRT

miniRT is a simple ray tracer written in C. It supports basic geometric primitives, various materials, and lighting effects. The goal of this project is to understand the fundamentals of ray tracing and computer graphics.

## Features

- Render basic geometric shapes (spheres, planes, squares, cylinders).
- Support for various materials (diffuse, specular, reflective).
- Implement basic lighting effects (ambient, point lights).
- Simple user interface for interacting with the scene.

## How to Use

To compile and run miniRT, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
